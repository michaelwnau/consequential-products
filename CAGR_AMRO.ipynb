        "2. Another source states that the NATO Military Aviation MRO market grew at a CAGR of 4.50% during 2020-2023, and is expected to reach $54.79 billion by 2030[2].\n",

        "Based on the available information, we can estimate that the US military MRO market is likely to see steady growth in the 3-5% CAGR range through 2030, given the overall growth trends in the broader military and North American MRO markets. This growth is being driven by factors like aging military aircraft fleets, ongoing operational requirements, and technological advancements requiring upgrades and maintenance[1][2].\n",
