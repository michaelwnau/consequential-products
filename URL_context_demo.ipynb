        "==================================================\n",
        "Both teriyaki tofu recipes aim for crispy tofu and a flavorful teriyaki sauce, but they differ in ingredients and cooking times.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Similarities:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Tofu Type:** Both recipes recommend using extra-firm tofu and pressing it to remove excess water.\n",
        "*   **Crisping Agent:** Both use cornstarch to achieve a crispy texture for the tofu.\n",
        "*   **Core Teriyaki Flavors:** Both recipes include soy sauce (or liquid aminos), ginger, garlic, and a sweetener in their teriyaki sauce.\n",
        "*   **Garnish:** Both suggest using chopped scallions and sesame seeds as a garnish.\n",
        "*   **Serving Suggestion:** Both recommend serving over rice.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Differences:\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Ingredients:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Teriyaki Sauce Base:**\n",
        "    *   Jessica in the Kitchen's recipe creates the teriyaki sauce from scratch using soy sauce, raw unrefined brown sugar (or coconut sugar), cornstarch, ground ginger, garlic powder, sesame seeds, rice wine vinegar, and water (or pineapple juice).\n",
        "    *   Allrecipes' recipe uses pre-made vegetarian teriyaki sauce as its base, then enhances it with green onions, sherry, minced garlic, Sriracha sauce (optional), and ginger paste. This implies a simpler sauce preparation in the Allrecipes version.\n",
        "*   **Sweetener:** Jessica in the Kitchen specifies raw unrefined brown sugar or coconut sugar. Allrecipes relies on the sweetness from the pre-made teriyaki sauce.\n",
        "*   **Acidity:** Jessica in the Kitchen uses rice wine vinegar. Allrecipes uses sherry.\n",
        "*   **Spice:** Allrecipes includes optional Sriracha sauce for a kick. Jessica in the Kitchen uses crushed red peppers for the teriyaki tofu marinade.\n",
        "*   **Oil for Tofu:** Jessica in the Kitchen uses sesame oil (or regular oil) for cooking the tofu. Allrecipes specifies olive oil.\n",
        "*   **Marinade for Tofu (before cooking):** Jessica in the Kitchen marinates the pressed tofu with light soy sauce (or liquid aminos), garlic powder, sea salt, black pepper, and cornstarch before cooking. Allrecipes only coats the pressed tofu in cornstarch before cooking.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Cooking Times:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Prep Time:**\n",
        "    *   Jessica in the Kitchen: 35 minutes (includes tofu pressing time).\n",
        "    *   Allrecipes: 10 minutes.\n",
        "*   **Cook Time:**\n",
        "    *   Jessica in the Kitchen: 15 minutes (8 minutes to crisp tofu, 4 minutes to thicken sauce, 2-3 minutes for tofu to sit in sauce).\n",
        "    *   Allrecipes: 15 minutes (5 minutes per side for tofu, 2 minutes to thicken sauce).\n",
        "*   **Total Time:**\n",
        "    *   Jessica in the Kitchen: 50 minutes.\n",
        "    *   Allrecipes: 25 minutes.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, the Allrecipes version is a quicker recipe with a shorter prep time, largely due to using a pre-made teriyaki sauce and a simpler tofu preparation before cooking. The Jessica in the Kitchen recipe involves making the teriyaki sauce from scratch and a more extensive tofu marinade, contributing to a longer prep and total time, but potentially offering more control over the flavor profile.\n",
