## Mindflayer: Analyzing Scientific Articles with OCR and Multimodal Models
The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) issued a SBIR topic looking for solutions to analyze scientific articles to detect potential proliferation-related threats. This is a problem that could benefit from a multimodal approach, with the model having to analyze text, images, and tables in order to detect threats. Mindflayer implements several processes to deal with the multimodal aspect of the problem, and includes a demonstration of concept to process a PDF and extract relevant information, labeling it, and storing the results in different structured formats.
